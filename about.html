    <h1>About NeuroVibe</h1>

    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Amanda.</strong> I’m a mom, wellness educator, and the founder of NeuroVibe.</p>

    <p>
      NeuroVibe exists to make wellness, nervous system regulation, and everyday support feel
      simple, calm, and actually doable—especially for neurodivergent families and overwhelmed parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I create guides, tools, and content that cut through the noise and focus on what really helps in real life.
      No perfection. No pressure. Just sustainable, supportive systems that meet you where you are.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also a mom to two amazing girls, and a lot of this work was born from lived experience—trying to
      support my family while navigating overwhelm, burnout, and the need for gentler, more realistic solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re here, you’re not alone—and you don’t have to do this the hard way. 💜
